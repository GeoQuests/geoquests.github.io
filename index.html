						<p class='description'>GeoQuest is a fun and social game, but
						first and foremost, it's a race.  Play against 
						other invitees and your friends in the quest
						to reach the final destination.  Whoever 
						gets there first wins, it's that simple.</p>

						<p class='description'>Throughout the quest work with your friends
						or the other participants to figure out clues
						and brag about success, of course.  However,
						remember that in the end it's a race, so don't
						give too much away to the competition!</p>

						<p class='description'>If you're playing with solely friends, the
						creator of the quest may have created
						personalized clues, so you'll have to use
						any information on them you can find.  If
						you're playing with strangers, the clues 
						are going to be more objective so don't be 
						afraid to look things up!</p>

							<h1 class='hook'>Writing good clues.</h1>
							<p class='description'>When writing your first and all clues for a quest 
							keep in mind who your target audience is.  If you 
							plan to create a game in your area where anyone
							can play, keep your clues objective and factual.
							If you're playing with friends, you can use personal
							information to see who knows you the best!</p>

							<h1 class='hook'>Know your location.</h1>
							<p class='description'>Keep in mind the location of your quest while creating
							one.  It is easy to get &quot;pin happy&quot; and create a lot
							of clues and add many locations.  If you're playing
							in an urban area with public transportation, you can
							possibly spread out your clues a bit more.  Otherwise,
							you may want to keep the locations more centrailzed,
							while making the clues a bit harder to solve.</p>

							<h1 class='hook'>Provide incentive.</h1>
							<p class='description'>Obviously it's fun to play with your friends in a 
							racing environment, however, providing incentive
							to your friends is a great way to up the participation
							rate.  It's also a great way to add fun to a treasure
							hunt type GeoQuest.  If you're planning a birthday
							hunt, try also adding rewards at each checkpoint,
							for extra fun!</p>

							<p class='description'>If there's bad weather, your friends probably
							aren't going to want to play with you outside in 
							bad weather.  Try to make sure that you plan the hunt
							for a nice day in order to get the most participation.  
							Obviously hunts might not necessarily take a whole
							day, but could take more or less.</p>

					<p class='description'>Because all quests are created by users, 
					for users, you may be invited to quests
					spanning your campus, city or even country!
					If you haven't been invited to any quests in
					your area, you can always create on and 
					invite your friends!</p>

					<p class='description'>GeoQuest is a fun and social game, but
					first and foremost, it's a race.  Play against 
					other invitees and your friends in the quest
					to reach the final destination.  Whoever 
					gets there first wins, it's that simple.</p>

					<p class='description'>Throughout the quest work with your friends
					or the other participants to figure out clues
					and brag about success, of course.  However,
					remember that in the end it's a race, so don't
					give too much away to the competition!</p>

					<p class='description'>If you're playing with solely friends, the
					creator of the quest may have created
					personalized clues, so you'll have to use
					any information on them you can find.  If
					you're playing with strangers, the clues 
					are going to be more objective so don't be 
					afraid to look things up!</p>

					<p class='description'>Because all quests are created by users, 
					for users, you may be invited to quests
					spanning your campus, city or even country!
					If you haven't been invited to any quests in
					your area, you can always create on and 
					invite your friends!</p>

					<p class='description'>GeoQuest is a fun and social game, but
					first and foremost, it's a race.  Play against 
					other invitees and your friends in the quest
					to reach the final destination.  Whoever 
					gets there first wins, it's that simple.</p>

					<h1 class='hook'>Work with others on the quest.</h1>
					<p class='description'>Throughout the quest work with your friends
					or the other participants to figure out clues
					and brag about success, of course.  However,
					remember that in the end it's a race, so don't
					give too much away to the competition!</p>

					<h1 class='hook'>Use anything at your disposal.</h1>
					<p class='description'>If you're playing with solely friends, the
					creator of the quest may have created
					personalized clues, so you'll have to use
					any information on them you can find.  If
					you're playing with strangers, the clues 
					are going to be more objective so don't be 
					afraid to look things up!</p>

					<h1 class='hook'>Writing good clues for a quest.</h1>
					<p class='description'>When writing your first and all clues for a quest 
					keep in mind who your target audience is.  If you 
					plan to create a game in your area where anyone
					can play, keep your clues objective and factual.
					If you're playing with friends, you can use personal
					information to see who knows you the best!</p>

					<h1 class='hook'>Know the location of your quest.</h1>
					<p class='description'>Keep in mind the location of your quest while creating
					one.  It is easy to get &quot;pin happy&quot; and create a lot
					of clues and add many locations.  If you're playing
					in an urban area with public transportation, you can
					possibly spread out your clues a bit more.  Otherwise,
					you may want to keep the locations more centrailzed,
					while making the clues a bit harder to solve.</p>

					<h1 class='hook'>Provide incentive to your friends.</h1>
					<p class='description'>Obviously it's fun to play with your friends in a 
					racing environment, however, providing incentive
					to your friends is a great way to up the participation
					rate.  It's also a great way to add fun to a treasure
					hunt type GeoQuest.  If you're planning a birthday
					hunt, try also adding rewards at each checkpoint,
					for extra fun!</p>
